# Emotion-recognition-using-facial-expressions
The aim of this project was Assess Loneliness emotions, so we were analyze the fer2013 data obtained from Kaggle, itâ€™s Facial Expression Recognition Dataset. Perform EDA on dataset and Extract Feature. Using keras function method to_categorical() a vector which has integers that represent different categories, can be converted into a numpy array to detect emotion of the image.
Key Skills: Python | NumPy | Machine Learning | Pandas | EDA | Visualization | Algorithms | Matplotlib | Keras.
